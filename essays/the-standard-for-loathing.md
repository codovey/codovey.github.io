## "Loathing! Unadulterated loathing!" -What is this Feeling, Wicked
If you couldn't tell by the title, I'm not the biggest fan of ESLint. The concept of picking out errors *seems* good, but it has caused me nothing but trouble; mostly because I'm still a novice coder. All of these little errors may show up, but I don't know how to fix them! That might be what someone calls a "skill issue", though.

Are my WOD efforts in vain because I don't know how indexes work, or is it my confusion over simple things like objects and functions? (Spoiler alert: it's both!)

### Stylizing Code: The One Thing I Know
If I can get better at knowing when to use what, ESLint would probably help a lot more. It's not as easy to learn when I'm clueless half the time. When I do know what I'm doing, I tend to space my code out in a way I find *aesthetic*. This includes grouping code in chunks. Some test cases may be line after line because they're similar. I'll leave a space between each group to show they have something slightly different going on.

There are times I get lazy or decide something would make more sense to me by leaving some code all in one line. I'm talking about the daisy chain of curly braces.

```
{
  {
    {
      these guys!
    } //this
  } //and this
} //and this
```

If I have a huge loop going on, I'll probably shove all the end curly braces into one line for my own convenience. It might not look the best to a professional software engineer, but it saves a millisecond of scrolling for me.

## The Girls of Wicked Find Something to Love About Each Other
- and so can I in regards to VSCode!

While I may not like VSCode as much for actual coding, **my repository** editing skills have skyrocketed. Everything is in one place, and I can easily edit my website now that I know how to push and pull from Github. It's super convenient, and I even wrote this little essay entirely on it! I also have my theme set to this nice dark red. Something about it feels unprofessional and calming when I'm working on something. 

Final rating: 10/10 vibe VSCode, 3/10 coding skills (DNF and error getter)
